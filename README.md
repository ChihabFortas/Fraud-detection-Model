# **Fraud Detection using regression model**

#### **Project overview**
The Tunisian company of electricity and gaz (STEG) is a non-administrative company, it is responsible for delivering electricity and gaz across Tunisia.
The company sufferred tremendous losses in order of 200 million tunisian dinars due to fraudelant manipulations of meters by consumers.

in this project we will be using data gathered by the company (Clients billing/consumption history) to detect and recognize cients involved in fraudelent activities. 


#### **Project structure** 
before start writing any code, first we need to understand the problem in details and set a some milestones to achieve in this project.

- Exploratory Data Analysis
  - downloading the data and converting it into a readable dataset
  - understanding the data 
  - Data preparation and cleaning
  - Deciding the features to build the model

- Model creation
  - Decide which type of Model fit to solve the problem in hand
  - Create the model based on input and output shape and the depth of model network
  - Create the model hyperparamater
  - create the training job 

- Visualizing and tuning
  - continue visualizing and tuning the hyperparamaters until we reach a optimized state
  - Model validation and testing
